🚀 How to Apply to Jobs with Timothy's AI Agent

## Quick Start

### 1. Interactive Mode (Easiest)
```bash
python job_application_runner.py
```
This will show you test URLs to choose from or let you enter a custom URL.

### 2. Direct URL Application
```bash
# Dry run (analyze only, don't fill forms)
python job_application_runner.py "https://company.com/careers/software-engineer"

# Live mode (actually fill the form)
python job_application_runner.py "https://company.com/careers/apply" --live

# Auto-submit after filling
python job_application_runner.py "https://company.com/careers/apply" --live --auto-submit
```

### 3. With Custom API Key
```bash
python job_application_runner.py "https://company.com/careers/apply" --api-key "your-deepseek-key"
```

## 🎯 What the Agent Does

When you provide a job application URL, Timothy's AI agent will:

### 1. **Page Analysis** (2-3 seconds)
- Navigate to the URL
- Detect job application forms
- Extract all form fields and their context

### 2. **AI Field Classification** (5-15 seconds)
- Analyze each field with DeepSeek AI
- Determine filling strategy for each field
- Extract questions from essay fields
- Identify fields to skip (assessments)

### 3. **Value Generation** (2-5 seconds)
- Map Timothy's profile data to simple fields
- Generate personalized essay responses
- Select appropriate dropdown options
- Prepare file uploads

### 4. **Form Execution** (10-30 seconds)
- Fill all classified fields
- Validate completion
- Optionally auto-submit

## 🛠️ Command Line Options

| Flag | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `url` | Job application URL (required) | `"https://company.com/apply"` |
| `--live` | Actually fill the form (default: dry run) | `--live` |
| `--auto-submit` | Submit after filling | `--auto-submit` |
| `--api-key` | Custom DeepSeek API key | `--api-key "sk-..."` |

## 🎯 Best Practices

### 1. **Start with Dry Runs**
Always test with dry run mode first to see what the AI will do:
```bash
python job_application_runner.py "https://company.com/careers/apply"
```

### 2. **Check the Analysis**
Review the AI's field classification and strategy before going live:
- ✅ **Simple mapping** fields should have correct values
- ✅ **RAG generation** fields should have appropriate questions extracted
- ✅ **Skip field** should identify assessments correctly

### 3. **Use Live Mode Carefully**
Only use `--live` mode when you're confident in the analysis:
```bash
python job_application_runner.py "https://company.com/careers/apply" --live
```

### 4. **Manual Review Before Auto-Submit**
Even with `--live`, avoid `--auto-submit` until you've tested several applications:
```bash
# Good: Fill form but don't submit
python job_application_runner.py "url" --live

# Careful: Auto-submit (only when confident)
python job_application_runner.py "url" --live --auto-submit
```

## 🔍 Understanding the AI Analysis

### Field Strategies

| Strategy | Description | Example Fields |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| **simple_mapping** | Direct data from Timothy's profile | Name, email, phone, GPA |
| **rag_generation** | AI-generated personalized content | Cover letters, essays, motivation |
| **option_selection** | Choose from dropdown/radio options | Degree level, experience years |
| **skip_field** | Don't fill (assessments, tests) | Coding challenges, personality tests |

### Confidence Levels

| Confidence | Meaning | Action |
|------------|---------|--------|
| 0.9 - 1.0 | Very confident | Proceed automatically |
| 0.8 - 0.9 | Confident | Proceed with validation |
| 0.6 - 0.8 | Moderate | Proceed with caution |
| < 0.6 | Low confidence | Review recommended |

## 🚫 What NOT to Do

### ❌ Don't Auto-Submit on First Try
```bash
# DON'T do this immediately
python job_application_runner.py "unknown-site.com/apply" --live --auto-submit
```

### ❌ Don't Skip the Dry Run
Always check the analysis first before using `--live`

### ❌ Don't Use on Non-Job Sites
The agent is designed for job applications - using it on other forms may not work correctly

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "No job application form found"
- The URL may not contain a job application form
- Try navigating to the specific application page
- Some sites require login before showing the form

### "AI classification failed"
- Check your internet connection
- Verify the DeepSeek API key is valid
- The page may have unusual form structure

### Low automation rate
- Some fields may require manual attention
- Complex custom fields may not be recognized
- Technical assessments are intentionally skipped

## 🎉 Success Tips

1. **Test on known job sites first** (LinkedIn, Indeed, company career pages)
2. **Review the generated content** before submitting
3. **Keep the dry run logs** to compare with actual applications
4. **Start with smaller companies** that have simpler forms
5. **Use the confidence scores** to gauge reliability

## 📈 Expected Performance

- **Simple forms (10-15 fields)**: 85-95% automation rate
- **Complex forms (20+ fields)**: 75-85% automation rate
- **Processing time**: 1-2 seconds per field
- **Essay generation**: High-quality, personalized responses
- **Error handling**: Graceful fallbacks for edge cases

The AI agent will continuously improve as it encounters more form types and learns from the patterns it sees! 🚀
